🎉 **Welcome to the Basic Calculator Program!** 🧮

Need to crunch a few numbers without opening a spreadsheet or launching a full-blown calculator app? You're in the right place! This **tiny but mighty** command-line calculator lets you add, subtract, multiply, and divide—right from your terminal. It's fast, it's clean, and it's written in plain ol’ Python!

When you run the program, you’ll be greeted with a friendly prompt asking for two numbers and the operation you’d like to perform (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`). Once you hit enter, it’ll instantly return the result with a nice formatted message. For example, type in `10`, `5`, and `*`—and voilà: `10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0`. Quick math, done right. 🔢✨

But wait—what if you try to divide by zero? 🚨 No worries! This calculator’s got your back. Instead of crashing, it politely tells you that *“Division by Zero isn't allowed!”* Because let's face it: even calculators have boundaries.

Under the hood, this script keeps it simple and smooth. It uses `float` conversions so you can work with decimals, and it leans on straightforward `if-elif` logic to pick the right operation. The code is compact (less than 30 lines!), crystal clear, and beginner-friendly—making it a perfect intro project for anyone diving into Python.

🌟 Feeling adventurous? You could totally upgrade this baby. Add exponentiation (`**`), support for continuous calculations in a loop, input validation for smoother UX, or even design a slick GUI version with Tkinter or PyQt. Sky’s the limit!

So whether you're learning Python, building your first CLI app, or just need to calculate 42 \* 17.5 on the fly, this little script is a perfect companion. 💡 Happy coding—and happy calculating!
